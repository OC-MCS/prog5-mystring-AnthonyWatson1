Are you copying this code from somewhere? You're trying to go *way* beyond the requirements.
Can't give any credit on code that won't compile, because it means that nothing has been tested.
You are writing WAY TOO MUCH code at one time; you need to write a small subset and get that to build/run before moving farther.  
That process will help you isolate errors and take way less time.    

Grade: 0/40 (but you can finish and re-submit for more credit. See me for help!
